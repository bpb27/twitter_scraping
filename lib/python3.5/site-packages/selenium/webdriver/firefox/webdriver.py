        Based on the combination and specificity of the various keyword
        arguments, a capabilities dictionary will be constructed that
        is passed to the remote end.

        The keyword arguments given to this constructor are helpers to
        more easily allow Firefox WebDriver sessions to be customised
        with different options.  They are mapped on to a capabilities
        dictionary that is passed on to the remote end.

        As some of the options, such as `firefox_profile` and
        `firefox_options.profile` are mutually exclusive, precedence is
        given from how specific the setting is.  `capabilities` is the
        least specific keyword argument, followed by `firefox_options`,
        followed by `firefox_binary` and `firefox_profile`.

        In practice this means that if `firefox_profile` and
        `firefox_options.profile` are both set, the selected profile
        instance will always come from the most specific variable.
        In this case that would be `firefox_profile`.  This will result in
        `firefox_options.profile` to be ignored because it is considered
        a less specific setting than the top-level `firefox_profile`
        keyword argument.  Similarily, if you had specified a
        `capabilities["firefoxOptions"]["profile"]` Base64 string,
        this would rank below `firefox_options.profile`.

        :param firefox_profile: Instance of ``FirefoxProfile`` object
            or a string.  If undefined, a fresh profile will be created
            in a temporary location on the system.
        :param firefox_binary: Instance of ``FirefoxBinary`` or full
            path to the Firefox binary.  If undefined, the system default
            Firefox installation will  be used.
